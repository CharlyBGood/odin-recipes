    <p>This recipe is a great way to fly without going out from home! And to have a great desert!! Haha</p>
    <h2>You'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A jar of Nutella</li>
        <li>Cannabis-infused oil</li>
        <li>A mixing bowl</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1:</b>
            <p>
                Place the Nutella into a mixing bowl. You’ll notice that we don’t recommend an amount. We will leave it entirely to your preferences.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 2:</b>
            <p>
                Mix in one dose of cannabis oil for every Nutella serving. Once mixed in, stir well until the oil is evenly distributed through the chocolate. You should no longer see the oil in the mixture.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Step 3:</b>
            <p>
                Keep it stored in the fridge. You can eat it any way you like, straight from the jar or on a slice of bread.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
