            <ol>
                <li>200g peanut butter (crunchy or smooth is fine)</li>
                <li>175g golden caster sugar</li>
                <li>¼ tsp fine table salt</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
            </ol>

            <h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Step 1:</b>
                        Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 large baking trays with baking parchment.
                </li>
                <li><b>Step 2:</b>
                        Measure the peanut butter and sugar into a bowl. Add ¼ tsp fine table salt and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add the egg and mix again until the mixture forms a dough. 
                </li>
                <li><b>Step 3:</b>
                        Break off cherry tomato sized chunks of dough and place, well spaced apart, on the trays. Press the cookies down with the back of a fork to squash them a little. The cookies can now be frozen for 2 months, cook from frozen adding an extra min or 2 to the cooking time.
                </li>
                <li><b>Step 4:</b>
                        Bake for 12 mins, until golden around the edges and paler in the centre. Cool on the trays for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Store in a cookie jar for up to 3 days.
                </li>
